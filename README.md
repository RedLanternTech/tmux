# tmux 

Decided to make my tmux config it's own repository.  

Feel free to download, use and change it as you see fit.

I do make use of tmux plugins

Also check out [learnlinux.tv](https://www.learnlinux.tv/?s=tmux) as that was the original source of my tmux configuration.

Another great source is [Awesome-tmux](https://github.com/rothgar/awesome-tmux)
